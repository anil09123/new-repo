What is Framework?

A software framework is a set of reusable software components that form the application development structure. It provides a predefined structure, rules, and guidelines that developers can build upon, reducing the need to start from scratch and enabling more efficient development.
Using frameworks, software developers and technical teams can speed up the development lifecycle, avoid errors, and reuse existing resources.
